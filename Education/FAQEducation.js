      question: "Who can donate blood?",
      answer: "Most people in good health, aged 18-65, weighing at least 50kg (110 lbs) can donate. Donors must meet specific health criteria and should not have any infectious diseases or recent risky exposures."
    },
    {
      question: "How often can I donate blood?",
      answer: "You can donate whole blood every 56 days (8 weeks). Platelet donations can be made more frequently - up to 24 times per year with at least 7 days between donations."
    },
    {
      question: "Does blood donation hurt?",
      answer: "You may feel a brief pinch when the needle is inserted, but the donation process itself is generally painless. Most donors compare it to a slight pinch lasting just a second."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a blood donation take?",
      answer: "The actual donation takes about 8-10 minutes for whole blood. The entire process (registration, health screening, donation, and recovery) takes about 45 minutes to an hour."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it safe to donate blood?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Sterile, disposable equipment is used for each donor, making the process completely safe. You cannot contract any disease by donating blood."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I do before donating?",
      answer: "Eat a healthy meal, drink plenty of fluids (especially water), get a good night's sleep, and bring your ID. Avoid fatty foods right before donation as they can affect blood tests."
    },
    {
      question: "What blood types are most needed?",
      answer: "All blood types are needed, but type O-negative (the universal donor) is especially valuable as it can be given to patients of any blood type in emergency situations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I donate if I have a tattoo or piercing?",
      answer: "Yes, but only if it was done at a licensed facility in your state and at least 4 months have passed. This ensures any potential infection would be detectable."
